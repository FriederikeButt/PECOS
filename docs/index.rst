Welcome to the PECOS Docs!
==========================

PECOS, which stands for "Performance Estimator of Codes On Surfaces," is a Python package that provides a framework for studying, developing, and evaluating quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). PECOS attempts to balance simplicity, functionality, and extendibility.

History
-------

The first incarnation of PECOS was created by Ciarán Ryan-Anderson in June 2014 to verify the lattice-surgery procedures in :arxiv:`1407.5103` [LRA14]_.
